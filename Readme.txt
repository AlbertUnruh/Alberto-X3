Here is the code from my discord.py Bot on my
server (www.discord.io/albertunruh)...
The code here is always synchronized with the
code from my Bot and so you spy into the
running code ;) ...

If you have some questions you can join me on
my dc and you can question your questions to
me.

I hope you'll have fun with the code, if you
are going to inspect it and otherwise I hope
to see you on my server.

(and please be not to hard to me with
my english(I'm a german student and
still studying))
